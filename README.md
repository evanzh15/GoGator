1. What is the nature of the gameplay? That is, what challenges will the player face? What actions will the player take to overcome those challenges? 

	The game is a simplified version of the classic game “Frogger” with a University of Florida twist. Instead of moving through an endless scrolling window, the gator can move up, left, right, or down to avoid vehicles (cars, RTS buses, mopeds, etc).

2. What is the victory condition for the game? What is the player trying to achieve? 

	Avoid obstacles and stay alive, whilst trying to collect as many collectable items as possible. These collectables can include pizza, pasta, hot dog, fries, ice cream, hydro flask, paper, ear-buds, computer, calculator, charger, phone, etc. There is no victory condition, the goal is to beat the high score (stored via file I/O).

3. What is the player's interaction model (mouse/keyboard)? 

	Mouse for navigating the main menu and specific arrow keys will be used to move the player model around the map. 

4. What is the general structure of the game? What is going on in each mode, and what function does each mode fulfill? 

	There will be two modes of difficulty: normal mode, cars going at a regular speed that will provide the user with a challenging experience getting across the map, and rush hour mode, where all obstacles will be moving significantly faster to induce greater challenge. Both modes will have their own highscore.

5. Does the game have a narrative or story as it goes along? If so, summarize the plot. 

	Albert the gator wants to go to campus, but he dropped his backpack in the middle of Archer Road. The player is tasked with guiding Albert in collecting his items, while avoiding the incoming traffic. 

6. Why would anyone want to play this game? What sort of people would be attracted to this game?

	Competition. They want to play as Albert, they love Albert.
